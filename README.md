**Tableau Public Visualization**

The data used are public information from minority-serving institutions (MSIs) across the United States. This was obtained during an internship application directed to Black and Brown Students.

## Short Written Reflection 

The idea of creating a clear story by reducing distracting visuals and highlighting only the most essential information is one of the most important lessons I learnt from the Data Storytelling with Tableau Public course. This led me to highlight the geographical distribution of Minority-Serving Institutions and the differences across MSI categories rather than filling the dashboard with pointless numbers, which helped shape my visualization. The main idea from the Tableau Data Model module was the use of relationships rather than traditional joins, which makes it simpler to work with multiple tables while maintaining the proper level of detail. This way of working is helpful in healthcare settings for connecting complex datasets, including diagnoses, lab results, patient visits, and provider information, without accidentally creating duplicate records.
